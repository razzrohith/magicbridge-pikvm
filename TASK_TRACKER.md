**Last updated:** 2026-07-19
**Repo HEAD:** `add6076` · github.com/razzrohith/magicbridge-pikvm
**Device:** ONLINE @ `172.16.20.212` (DHCP moved it from .209), hostname
`DESKTOP-LGA3O5H` (realistic, stable). All work below deployed + verified on-device.
**How to update this file:** see the "Maintenance protocol" at the bottom.

### 🎥🐛📦 DIY sync — capture-detect + installer bugfixes (handoff 8b / 5d / 20, 2026-07-19)
- **8b capture auto-detect → SKIP (informational), device-verified.** V4 Mini is
  CSI-only: `/dev/video0`=`unicam` via onboard TC358743 (`/soc/csi@7e801000`), no USB
  UVC node. kvmd owns the pipeline; Dell-EDID stealth already on the CSI path. Would
  only matter if a USB-capture variant ships.
- **5d(a) tmpfs `mode=0755` → N/A.** We mount no tmpfs log dir; `/var/log` is tmpfs
  natively (doctor only reads it). No `mode=1777` anywhere.
- **5d(b) SIGPIPE guard → FIXED** (`c302a7b`). Guarded both `tr…</dev/urandom|head`
  pipelines (`mb-anon-defaults.sh`, `mb-firstboot.sh`) with `|| true`; repo sweep found
  only those two. Device-verified: unguarded aborts `rc=141` under `set -euo pipefail`,
  guarded returns `rc=0`. `mb-anon-defaults.sh` re-confirmed idempotent (hostname + MAC
  stable across two runs).
- **20 imaging strips identity → done + extended** (`add6076`). MAC-strip already present
  (`mb-imageprep.sh` clears `70-mb-*.link`); `video.mode=auto` N/A (CSI-only). Added:
  strip `/etc/avahi/services/*.mb-bak` so the neutralized-mDNS backup (carries PiKVM
  tells on disk, never broadcast) doesn't ship inside a distributable image.
- **Reconcile sweep (live):** RAM logs ✅, nginx access-log off ✅, **no `_pikvm` on the
  wire** (`avahi-browse`) ✅, hostname realistic ✅, MAC `78:bd:bc:f8:8d:ea` persisted &
  live ✅, EDID DELL P2419H ✅, USB Logitech `046d:c52b` ✅, all services active ✅.

### 🔒 Anonymity hardening — handoff items 4, 5, 5b, 5c (verified on-device 2026-07-19)
- **Realistic hostname (#5b):** `magicbridge` → per-unit `DESKTOP-XXXXXXX` (stable,
  idempotent). Branded mDNS aliases (`magicbridge.local`/`kvm.local`) OFF by default.
- **kvmd `_pikvm._tcp` mDNS advert neutralized (#5b):** it broadcast "PiKVM Web Server /
  Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 / board=rpi4 / serial" to any mDNS scan — emptied.
- **Realistic MAC default (#4):** networkd `.link` with a real vendor OUI (the kvmd-correct
  equivalent of DIY's NM `cloned-mac-address`; `ip link set` reverts, this sticks).
  ⏳ **applies on the next reboot** (I did not reboot the live unit unsupervised — a MAC
  change moves the DHCP IP).
- **No re-brand (#5c):** installer stopped force-setting `magicbridge`; the idempotent
  `mb-anon-defaults.sh` keeps realistic values and never re-randomizes.
- **Defaults verified realistic (#5):** USB Logitech `046d:c52b`, EDID `DELL P2419H`,
  MAC realistic, all survive `mb-secret-reset` on a clone.
- Mechanism: `mb-anon-defaults.sh` + `mb-anon-defaults.service` (boot, idempotent) +
  installer + first-boot + secret-reset. Opt-out: `MB_MAC_AUTOSPOOF`/`MB_HOSTNAME_REALISTIC`.

### 🎥 Live video VERIFIED on-device (HDMI connected, 2026-07-19)
- HDMI source connected; capture works end-to-end. `v4l2` detects **1920×1080@60**
  from the source (our Dell EDID makes it output 1080p, honored). ustreamer starts
  on-demand (kvmd stops it 10s after the last client — the idle 640×480 is just the
  no-client default), locks to 1080p, and the cockpit shows the **live 1920×1080**
  frame (MJPEG path confirmed; "No signal" overlay hidden, Status=Live).
- Fixed a UI carry-over exposed by the live test: transport labels said
  `WebRTC (C790/CSI)` / `MJPEG (USB dongle)` (DIY board name + nonexistent dongle) →
  `WebRTC (H.264)` / `MJPEG (fallback)` (commit `1c2f27f`).
### ⌨️🖱 HID input VERIFIED on-device (USB K/M gadget connected, 2026-07-19)
- Gadget bound to the host (`UDC=fe980000.usb`), `mouse.online:true absolute:true`.
- **Keyboard E2E ✅** — tapped Caps Lock via `/api/hid/events/send_key`, kvmd's
  `leds.caps` flipped `false→true` (the host received the key, toggled state, and
  reported the LED back to the gadget — full round-trip). Second tap restored it;
  no characters typed. `keyboard.online` also came `true` after activity.
- **Mouse (absolute) E2E ✅** — injected `send_mouse_move` to opposite corners; the
  captured screen showed the cursor land top-left, then bottom-right (hover popped
  the taskbar clock tooltip). Precise 1:1 absolute positioning. Cursor returned to
  center; no clicks issued on the live target.
- ⏳ Still open: WebRTC/H.264 negotiation in a REAL browser (headless fell back to
  MJPEG — MJPEG path is proven at 1080p); "Video FPS" readout shows "—" on the
  MJPEG-fallback path (cosmetic). Minor: MAC/hostname across a real reboot.

### 💿 Flashable image tooling — handoff item 20 (2026-07-19)
- **`provision/build-image.sh` built + tested** (`bf64f3f`). Arms a golden-unit `.img`
  OFFLINE (card stays an untouched backup). Detects partitions by **label/content,
  never index** — PiKVM has 4 partitions and root is **p3**; DIY hardcodes p2, which
  here is the 256M PST store, so DIY's script would strip *nothing*. Empties the MSD
  partition (uploaded ISOs). Hard-fails on LUKS. `--verify` asserts 17 strips.
- **LUKS: NOT used by PiKVM** — verified (empty `crypttab`, no dm-crypt, no
  `crypto_LUKS`). The DIY de-LUKS step is skipped entirely.
- **Three latent bugs found + fixed that would each have broken a flashed unit:**
  1. `mb-firstboot.service` was in the git tree but **never installed** to
     `/etc/systemd/system` (installer gap). A flashed card would never personalize →
     every unit sharing SSH keys/machine-id/MAC/TLS. Installed + enabled (verified
     inert on the golden unit: `ConditionResult=no`); build-image self-heals it too.
  2. `mb-secret-reset` regenerated TLS only *if a cert existed* — but arming strips
     certs, so first boot would leave **no** cert and `kvmd-nginx` would fail to
     start (bricked unit). Now unconditional (`bf64f3f`).
  3. `ipmipasswd`/`vncpasswd` never reset → every unit shipping PiKVM's stock
     `admin` credential (factory tell + shared secret). Fixed (`ce2d845`).
- **Gotchas re-checked:** (a) `/var/log` tmpfs is **755 root:root**, not 1777, and
  `fs.protected_regular=1` → bug class N/A; our installer also already refuses to run
  `nginx -t` (gates on `systemctl restart kvmd-nginx`). (b) SIGPIPE guards done
  earlier (`c302a7b`).
- **REAL IMAGE BUILT (2026-07-19).** Golden card read to
  `E:\Startup\flashOS_PIKVM\magicbridge-pikvm-base.img` (29.72 GB, byte-exact vs the
  card) → armed to `magicbridge-pikvm-dist.img`. Root correctly detected as **p3**,
  no LUKS, MSD emptied (the golden unit's 169 MB ISO gone), PST clean. **All 19
  `--verify` checks pass.** Independent audit also confirmed: hostname reset to the
  `magicbridge` placeholder tell (so anon-defaults regenerates), no residual old
  machine-id or old MAC anywhere, no bash history, `/var/log` empty.
- **Bug the real run exposed** (`a844911`) — caught by an independent audit, NOT by
  the script's own assertions: arming deleted `/etc/kvmd/htpasswd`, but
  `kvmd-htpasswd add -i` edits an EXISTING store, so first boot would have left the
  unit with **no web login**. htpasswd is now KEPT (anonymity-neutral — an identical
  value on every unit cannot cross-link them), and secret-reset recreates it from
  PiKVM's shipped default if absent. ipmipasswd/vncpasswd/TLS were never at risk
  (those are recreated with `printf >` / `openssl`).
- ⏳ Next: flash a 2nd card from `dist.img`, confirm the OLED→hotspot→WiFi flow, then
  prove uniqueness (hostname / MAC / SSH host key / machine-id all differ from golden).
- **SHRUNK + hardened (`61a6e5a`): 29.72 GB -> 6.72 GB.** Only ~2.8 GB was ever in
  use; the bulk was the empty 23.2 GB MSD partition. `build-image.sh --shrink`
  resize2fs -M's the MSD fs, shrinks the partition (via **sfdisk** — parted refuses
  its "shrinking can cause data loss" prompt even under `-s`) and truncates the file.
  Refuses unless PIMSD is genuinely the LAST partition. Root free space was zeroed
  first, so deleted-file remnants (WiFi conf, SSH keys, logs, history) are erased —
  and truncating the MSD region physically removed the deleted-ISO remnants, so the
  earlier "not safe to distribute" caveat is now RESOLVED.
- **`mb-expand-msd.sh` (new)** grows MSD back to fill whatever card the image is
  flashed onto, on first boot. Finds the partition BY LABEL (`PIMSD`), refuses to
  grow anything that is not last, no-ops when already full; every failure path just
  remounts and exits 0 (worst case: a smaller MSD — root is a different partition).
  **Untested on hardware** until the first flash.
- Final: 19/19 `--verify` pass after shrink; partition table p1 256M / p2 256M /
  p3 6G / p4 224.6M. Compressed to **`magicbridge-pikvm-dist.img.xz` = 579 MB**
  (51x smaller than the 29.72 GB original; `xz -t` verified intact). Imager flashes
  `.img.xz` natively. `pishrink` was NOT needed and remains unused.
- ⏳ **Untested on hardware:** `mb-expand-msd.sh` has never run on a real unit. Check
  MSD size on the first flashed card; if it did not grow, the unit still works fine
  (root is a separate partition) and only virtual-media capacity is affected.

### 🔧 Feature fixes from the deep-analysis backlog (2026-07-20, `7e11c51`)
Device OFFLINE → code + syntax/headless-parse verified; runtime confirm pending-device.
- **Video FPS readout** (was `—`): the old per-`<img>`-load estimate never fires in
  Chrome for multipart MJPEG. Now read from kvmd's own `queued_fps`/`captured_fps`
  in the 5s status poll — reliable in every browser.
- **USB MSD-hide / safe-mode** (was an inert stored TODO): safe-mode now trims the
  gadget for real — `write_otg_override(hide_msd)` emits
  `otg.devices.msd.default.enabled=false`, removing the mass-storage interface (a
  real Logitech receiver has none — the last USB tell). Applies live + reports the
  virtual-media trade-off. Default unchanged (MSD on); safe-mode is the opt-in.
  ⏳ true auto-hide-on-empty (mount-event driven) is a follow-up.
- **Login brute-force lockout:** stealth gate = per-IP escalating lockout in-code
  (5 free, then 15s→15min doubling; 429 + UI message); main kvmd login = nginx
  `limit_req` ~12/min on `/api/auth/login` only, via `mb-nginx-ratelimit.sh` that
  self-verifies + self-reverts (web UI can never go down) and runs post-boot.

### 🐛 Code audit findings (2026-07-22, device offline) — FIXED + PENDING
Ran a full read-only audit while the Pi was unreachable (NordVPN). Two safe sidecar
bugs fixed on main; the boot-critical ones are documented with proposed fixes but
NOT applied — they need a fresh-flash test (a first-boot mistake bricks a card).

**FIXED on main (safe, offline-verified, deploy on next align_pi):**
- **Stealth USB-identity YAML injection + 500** (`1d64578`). Custom
  manufacturer/product/serial went verbatim into a double-quoted YAML scalar in
  `write_otg_override` — a `"`/newline broke the YAML → gadget rebuild fails →
  target USB keyboard/mouse dead. Also `int(str(vendor_id),0)` in `set_identity`
  was unguarded → non-numeric id 500'd. Added `_clean_usb_str()` (strips control
  chars + `"`/`\`, caps 126) at the single choke point + id validation. Unit-tested
  offline: legit identities unchanged, injection neutralized.
- **Agent macros bypassed the feature flag** (`1d64578`). `run()` 403s when the
  agent is disabled, but `save_macro`/`run_macro` did not — so with the agent OFF
  (default) an authed caller could still run HID keystroke macros on the target.
  Added the `agent_enabled()` 403 guard to both.

**PENDING — need a fresh-flash test before applying (boot-critical, do NOT apply blind):**
- **[med] First-boot branding runs on a read-only rootfs → silent no-op.**
  `mb-firstboot.sh`: `mb_rw` (L41) → `mb-anon-defaults.sh` (L46) which ends `mb_ro`
  → `apply_branding.py` (L70) then writes theme.generated.css / patches index.html /
  writes the OLED override on a RO fs (EROFS, hidden by `>/dev/null`). Bounded (files
  are baked at install; re-apply is dead), but a branding.env change never takes on
  first boot. **Proposed:** add `mb_rw` right after the `mb-anon-defaults.sh` call
  (L46) so L49-80 run rw. One line; verify on a fresh flash.
- **[med] Concurrent first-boot remount race → possible provisioning LOOP.**
  `mb-firstboot.service` and `mb-anon-defaults.service` are both
  `WantedBy=sysinit.target` with NO ordering between them, and firstboot ALSO runs
  `mb-anon-defaults.sh` internally. The standalone service's `mb_ro` can fire in
  firstboot's marker-write window (L78-80) → marker write fails → first-boot re-runs
  every boot → re-wipes the just-entered WiFi (the catastrophic loop the code fights).
  **Proposed:** add `After=mb-firstboot.service` to `mb-anon-defaults.service` to
  serialize them (firstboot skipped-after-done still orders correctly). Flash-test.
  Related: `mbcommon.save_config` toggling the SHARED global rootfs ro in `finally`
  can EROFS a concurrent sidecar save — non-refcounted rw/ro across services is a
  latent architectural risk worth a refcount/lock.
- **[low] Gemini agent provider can never work.** `_ask_llm` sends the OpenAI wire
  format (Bearer auth, `choices[0].message`) to Google's endpoint, which uses
  `:generateContent` + `?key=`. Always 502s. Agent is off by default. Either
  implement Google's schema or drop `gemini` from `PROVIDERS`.

### ✅ Handoff items 31-36 — updater "reports success but not live" family (2026-07-21)
DIY session added 31-36 (all one failure mode: a change that reports success but
isn't live). Checked each against OUR code, fixed only what's real, verified on the
live unit @ 172.16.20.171.
- **31 — updater said "up to date" while nothing deployed: REAL, FIXED** (`4801639`).
  `update_check` compared clone HEAD to origin; `update_apply` did `git reset` FIRST
  then restarted — an interrupt in between left HEAD==origin → fake "up to date", no
  UI retry. Now: apply deploys structural bits (units/nginx/override) when changed,
  then STAMPS `/opt/magicbridge/.mb-deployed` as its last success-only step; check
  compares the STAMP to origin, never HEAD; missing stamp → "deployment unverified →
  reinstall". magic-install + build-image stamp too. **Verified on hardware:**
  reproduced the mid-apply state (old check "0 behind", new check "1 available"),
  missing-stamp → reinstall, and a REAL apply round-trip deploy+stamp → "up to date".
- **34 — expired session made every control a silent no-op: REAL (client), FIXED**
  (`4801639`). One 401 wrapper around the real fetch (auth endpoints excluded) →
  bounce to login once; piPower checks its result. **Verified on hardware** (headless
  Chrome: wiped cookies, triggered a control → bounced to /login/). Server-side
  already-safe (only non-critical OLED Popen; power via kvmd ATX = real status).
- **32 N/A** — updater is a Python handler, not a self-pulling bash script; the only
  installer (magic-install.sh) doesn't git-pull. No open-fd/old-inode hazard.
- **33 N/A** — update path does no config migration; it restarts every sidecar anyway.
- **35 N/A** — no UI control halts the Pi ("Shutdown/Reboot Pi" → kvmd ATX = the
  TARGET's power; no Pi self-poweroff anywhere). Nothing can land a shutdown mid-apply.
- **36 already-safe** — allowlist classifier, not "unknown→full"; 25-commit audit:
  2 fulls, both genuine (real systemd unit changes), zero false-fulls.
- **Bug the live apply exposed + fixed** (`4801639`): `git config --global
  safe.directory` could never write /root/.gitconfig on the RO rootfs (noisy
  `$HOME not set` / RO error every apply) → replaced with inline `git -c
  safe.directory=`; root owns the repo so no ownership check fires. Dogfooded clean.
- **Discovered, NOT fixed (separate bug):** the "Shutdown/Reboot Pi" buttons drive
  kvmd ATX = the TARGET's power, not the Pi. Mislabel — flag for its own task.
- Device left at `4801639`, honest stamp, "up to date", all services active.

### ✅ ON-HARDWARE verification (device back online @ 172.16.20.171, 2026-07-21)
Reached it only after disabling NordVPN — the item-28 gotcha proving itself (VPN blocks LAN).
Deployed HEAD, then tested live. Two things my OFFLINE work had gotten wrong, caught + fixed:
- **Safe-mode / MSD-hide: was BROKEN, now FIXED** (`1ae7fb2`). The `otg.devices.msd.default.
  enabled=false` key was silently ignored — kvmd only builds mass_storage when
  `kvmd.msd.type=="otg"` (kvmd/apps/otg:319). Switched to `kvmd.msd.type: disabled`. Verified:
  safe-mode ON → `mass_storage.usb0` GONE (only 3 HID funcs, keyboard+mouse intact) → OFF → BACK.
- **Main-login nginx rate-limit: DOESN'T WORK, disabled** (`24fd3ed`). `limit_req` never throttles
  under kvmd's rendered config (exact location matched via a `return 418` probe; zone defined;
  yet 25 rapid logins + even rate=2r/m all returned 200). Safe (web never went down) but inert →
  removed from the boot path; documented. Stealth-gate lockout is the working protection.
- **Verified working live:** 26 save_wifi replace (device python3: 1 block, wrong PSK gone),
  27 mb-portal TimeoutStartSec=infinity (installed unit), 28 avahi daemon+socket both active +
  DESKTOP-B5BFSPR.local resolves + boot report reach-me line, 29 boot report decodes
  get_throttled (0x0=OK), stealth-gate lockout (5→429), FPS readout reads kvmd counters (not "—").
- ⏳ Only genuinely-untriggerable-now: 26 full wrong-PSK→hotspot→reconnect E2E (needs a reboot
  into provisioning — disruptive), the LOW POWER banner firing (needs real under-voltage).

### 🔁 DIY imaging sync — first-boot bug audit + repo-HEAD base (handoff 24/25, 2026-07-20)
Device was OFFLINE (flashed unit not on the LAN) → prepared + committed, on-hardware confirm pending.
- **24-i SSH/web dead on fresh flash → ALREADY SAFE** (`4c728d1`): mb-firstboot is
  Before=sysinit.target so keys/TLS regen before sshd/kvmd-nginx start; TLS regen already
  unconditional. Proven live this session (.171 came up with SSH + web 200). Added a
  deadlock-safe post-boot restart-if-failed in mb-firstboot-late.
- **24-ii restart deadlock → ALREADY SAFE**: zero systemctl restart in the boot chain.
- **24-iii portal :80 bind → SAFE BY DESIGN**: portal binds :8080 + DNATs :80/:443
  (PREROUTING). Proven live: http://192.168.73.1 worked all session.
- **24-iv stuck unit undiagnosable → FIXED** (`4c728d1`): new mb-boot-report.sh writes a
  Windows/macOS-readable report to the FAT PIBOOT partition (first-boot marker, hostapd/
  portal state, :80 holder, DNAT, services, errors — no secrets). Hooked from mb-firstboot
  + mb-portal. Exactly the visibility we lacked when the loop struck this session.
- **25 base = clean repo HEAD → DONE** (`4ad13ba`): build-image git-fetch+reset+clean syncs
  the baked /opt/magicbridge to origin/main HEAD before arming → fresh unit reports
  up-to-date (not a day-one reinstall) AND pulls all fixes in cleanly (no hand-patching).
  wtmp/btmp/lastlog N/A (/var/log tmpfs) but stripped defensively. Applied to dist.img:
  bf64f3f+7-dirty → clean HEAD; --verify now 25 checks, all pass.
- ⏳ Pending-device: confirm the PIBOOT report lands on a real stuck unit; confirm fresh
  flash reports up-to-date.

### 🛡️ FRESH-FLASH NOW SELF-COMPLETING + BULLETPROOF (mb-firstboot-late, 2026-07-20)
Made a fresh flash finish itself with zero manual steps, and immune to the 3 bugs above.
- **New post-boot oneshot `mb-firstboot-late.service`** (`6cde694`): (1) grows MSD to fill
  the card (ONLINE resize), (2) applies a UNIQUE per-unit EDID monitor serial. Both need a
  fully-up system, which is why they can't live in early mb-firstboot. Ordered
  `After=kvmd.service/multi-user.target` with NOTHING depending on it -> can never block
  boot or WiFi. Marker-guarded -> runs once (EDID serial + MSD size stay stable). Best-
  effort; worst case = smaller MSD / baked EDID serial, never a broken/looping unit.
- **PROVEN live on .171**: Result=success, MSD-grow no-ops when full, EDID serial ->
  CN05062NN (valid Dell P2419H, confirmed in the persisted hex), marker written, services
  untouched.
- Wired everywhere: build-image enables it (self-heal + clear marker), magic-install
  installs+enables, mb-imageprep clears its marker. --verify now 23 checks.
- **Net effect:** flash to any blank card -> boot -> hotspot -> WiFi -> comes up unique +
  stealthed AND fills the card + unique EDID, on its own. The failure classes are designed
  out: nofail (can't block boot), rw-before-marker (can't loop), post-boot finalize (can't
  stall provisioning).

### ✅ FLASHED UNIT FULLY WORKING + VERIFIED (172.16.20.171, 2026-07-20)
The distributable-image path is proven end-to-end after fixing 3 real hardware-only bugs.
- **Real loop bug (`2a03804`):** first-boot SUCCEEDS in ~12s, but mb-secret-reset /
  mb-anon-defaults each end by remounting rootfs **read-only**, so the done-marker
  write (`date > .mb-firstboot-done`) failed silently on a RO fs. No marker → first-boot
  re-runs every boot → re-wipes the just-entered WiFi → provisioning loop. Diagnosed via
  on-device data pulled over the setup hotspot (a self-contained offline fix script, since
  joining the hotspot kills the laptop's internet). Fix: force rw + verify + sync before
  the marker. (All earlier timeout theories were wrong.)
- **MSD grow (`3d47e9a`):** offline resize2fs failed (kvmd keeps MSD mounted) → switched to
  ONLINE resize (remount rw → resize2fs → ro). MSD 224MB → **229GB**, writable.
- **Verified UNIQUE vs golden** (all differ): hostname DESKTOP-B5BFSPR, MAC 34:17:eb (HP
  OUI, stable), machine-id 462edcb7, own SSH host key + TLS cert, EDID serial CN21233ZK.
- **All services active**, web login magicbridge/magicbridge → 200.
- **Anonymity confirmed from the TARGET (laptop):** USB = Logitech "USB Receiver"
  046D:C52B (kbd+mouse+mass-storage, NO Pi/Linux/Gadget/File-Stor tell, no phantom drive);
  HDMI EDID = DELL P2419H serial CN21233ZK (real monitor, unique per unit); on-device: RAM
  logs, no _pikvm on the wire, clean hostname.
- ⚠ Board logged **Undervoltage** — recommend a stronger USB-C PSU for stability.
- Minor: mb-firstboot's EDID-serial randomize didn't take on first boot (applied manually
  live); worth confirming the firstboot EDID step on the next build.

### 🔥 First real flash: bricked boot → root-caused + fixed (2026-07-19)
- Flashed `dist.img` onto a **238 GB** card; unit came up on WiFi (ping + **unique
  Intel MAC `a0:88:b4`**, different from golden `78:bd:bc` ✅) BUT **no service
  listened** — SSH/kvmd/web all refused, ~17 min. OLED showed an IP (a stale
  retained frame, not proof of health).
- **Root cause:** `mb-expand-msd` grew MSD to ~232 GB (partition table confirmed on
  the card), but stock PiKVM fstab mounts `PIMSD` **without `nofail`**, so the
  failed/racy mount took down `local-fs.target` and blocked the whole boot past
  networking. Exactly the untested-code risk flagged when the expand was added.
- **Fix (`649dfcd`):** build-image now sets `nofail,x-systemd.device-timeout=15s`
  (fsck pass 0) on `PIMSD` + `PIPST` — a non-essential partition can NEVER block
  boot again (worst case: MSD unmounted). `mb-expand-msd` hardened with
  `udevadm settle` (stale-table reread race) + a second `e2fsck -p`. `--verify` now
  asserts nofail (21 checks). Tested on the synthetic image (idempotent).
- **Recovery:** `wsl --mount` of the physical card needs admin (unavailable), so
  patched the existing `dist.img` in place instead (loop-mount a file needs no
  elevation): added nofail + refreshed provision scripts, re-verified 21/21,
  recompressed. User re-flashing the same card.
- **STEALTH LAYER PROVEN on real hardware (from the laptop/target):** USB =
  Logitech "USB Receiver" `046D:C52B` (no Pi/Linux/gadget tell, no phantom drive);
  HDMI EDID = Dell P2419H (DEL, no capture-card tell); LAN MAC = Intel OUI, unique
  per unit. The anonymity model works; only the boot-robustness bug remained.
- ⏳ Pending: re-flash boots (nofail guarantees it) → full on-device uniqueness +
  anonymity + services sweep; confirm MSD expand result with the hardened script.

## ⏳ Pending / needs action

### Human-gated (only Raj can do these — not code work)
- [ ] **Tailscale sign-in** — open the login link from Network → Bring up, approve the device
      on your tailnet. (Plumbing verified; the OAuth step can't be automated.)
- [ ] **Eyeball the redesigned UI + OLED** — hard-refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R) `/login/`, `/mb/ui/`,
      `/stealth/` and glance at the front panel (should now read `MagicBridge`, not `V2`).
- [ ] **Reboot-verify MAC persistence (B8)** — the `.link` mechanism is tested on a dummy
      iface; a real reboot with a spoofed wlan0 MAC would confirm end-to-end. Low risk;
      do it on the next natural reboot.

### Open engineering tasks (nice-to-have / hardening)
- [x] **Login page folded into `magic-install.sh`** (2026-07-18) — phase 3 now deploys
      `web/login_index.html` → `/usr/share/kvmd/web/login/index.html`, so a fresh flash reproduces
      the branded, 2FA-free login. Installer `REPO_URL`/`RAW_URL` fixed to `magicbridge-pikvm`;
      installer's own `MagicBridgeV2`/`V2` strings rebranded.
- [ ] **Native `/kvm/` fallback still shows PiKVM tells** (41 on-device) — kvmd's own multi-file
      view, reverts on kvmd update. Controller-facing only (not target-facing), rarely used
      (our cockpit is default). Rebrand via installer or hide the fallback link. *(Priority: low.)*
- [ ] **Fresh-install NOT end-to-end tested** — installer is correct by inspection + syntax-checked,
      but hasn't been run on a clean PiKVM flash (no spare device). Verify on the next reimage.
- [ ] **nginx RAM-log EACCES** (from V1, may or may not exist on V2) — `nginx -t` can fail
      opening its access log; a cold restart could then fail. Check `/etc/logrotate.d/` for a
      `su`/`create` directive. *(Priority: low, but it's the only front door — confirm before
      touching.)*
- [ ] **AI Agent** — built but hidden behind a flag. Reveal only when Raj decides. When revealed,
      note it bundles Clips/Macros/Quick-Actions too (V1 side-effect).
- [ ] Optional: WiFi network **priority** ordering in the saved-network manager.
- [ ] Optional: keyboard layouts beyond US.

### Aspirational (never fully existed, incl. V1)
- [ ] Real bidirectional OS clipboard sync (the #1 wish-list item — hard, needs a target-side agent).
- [ ] Full-speed USB cap + auxiliary 3rd HID (deep gadget tweaks).

| Date | Commit | What |
|------|--------|------|
| 2026-07-18 | `e395b5d` | **DIY→PiKVM port (docs/PIKVM_PORT_HANDOFF.md), done offline:** anonymity — nginx access-log off (#1,#2), per-unit `mb-secret-reset.sh` + realistic default MAC-OUI + Dell EDID at first-boot (#3,#4,#5,#20), rfkill in portal (#6). Update tooling — incremental `align_pi.py` + git safe.directory (#22,#23), installer `--check` doctor (#21), OLED "Updating…" during self-update (#19). UI — cockpit re-based on DIY's latest (Software-Update category #16, "How the target sees it" identity card #14, connected-viewers, em-dash cleanup #17). Skipped #8 (kvmd native WebRTC) and #9-descriptor (kvmd native absolute mouse). #10/#11/#13/#15 already landed with the DIY-UI port. |
| 2026-07-18 | `a577926` | **UI overhaul — pro cyan-HUD redesign across all pages (login/cockpit/stealth):** new MagicBridge robot-face logo everywhere; gradient-mesh + HUD-grid backdrop, glass cards w/ hover-lift, animated nav, gradient wordmark, glowing LEDs, fluid transitions. **Esc = hold-to-exit** capture (single tap → target, hold ~2.5s or Right-Ctrl → release) w/ fullscreen + Keyboard Lock, release bar, recapture overlay, predictive cursor. **2FA field removed** from login. Skipped DIY-only bits (WoL, target-audio, OLED-settings, HID-autodisconnect, C790); kept our extras (VNC, EDID, clients, peers, LED, logs, DuckDNS, MAC). kvmd/sidecar wiring reused verbatim. ⚠️ Not yet runtime-tested in a browser (cert/origin approval needed) — verified via node --check + full authenticated render. |
| 2026-07-18 | `75f4a92` | **Bug-audit sweep — 6 verified bugs fixed & tested on-device:** MAC spoof now persists across reboot (systemd-networkd `.link`, + validation + `clear`); DuckDNS no longer marks enabled on `KO`; net `_ro()` real remount fallback; wifi/scan uses `await asyncio.sleep` (was blocking the event loop); stealth safe-mode returns an honest note; **AI-agent `key` steps now fire for real** via kvmd `send_key`/`send_shortcut` (+ key normalizer). Agent stays flag-disabled. |
| 2026-07-18 | `98bf77a` | Rebrand `MagicBridgeV2`→`MagicBridge` deployed to Pi 209 (`align_pi.py`); OLED override re-stamped to `MagicBridge` + `kvmd-oled` restarted |
| 2026-07-17 | `d5b7480` | Docs: all 6 polish phases done; final smoke test passed |
| 2026-07-17 | `842c42e` | **Phase 6:** fixed VNC toggle (os.symlink boot-persist + start/stop; `enable` EROFS), verified 2FA end-to-end |
| 2026-07-17 | `c6f7656` | **Phase 5:** System telemetry — WiFi latency/signal, connected clients, Tailscale peers, video detail |
| 2026-07-17 | `95b71cc` | **Phase 4:** killed CAFEBABE serials (USB + monitor), surfaced live MAC/serial, **fixed save_config not persisting** (RO rootfs), stripped 2 PiKVM literals |
| 2026-07-17 | `112fa2a` | **Phase 3:** fixed Tailscale (rootfs unlock + recover login URL + nginx timeout); added saved-WiFi manager; fixed the same `wpa_passphrase` bug in wifi_connect |
| 2026-07-17 | `f2c7fec` | **Phase 2:** removed Virtual Media + Wake-on-LAN; kept ATX w/ honest note |
| 2026-07-17 | `7ae5597` | **Phase 1:** professional glass UI (cockpit + stealth), custom login page, hid stealth nav link |
| 2026-07-17 | `e909cbf` | Captive portal: fixed `rw()`/`ro()` recursion crash + portal `_done` on every POST |
| 2026-07-17 | `cbda878` | Captive portal: plain-quoted psk (not wpa_passphrase) + save-then-reboot |
| 2026-07-17 | `552f289` | Captive portal: run via bash in unit, logs/leases to /run, dnsmasq bind-dynamic |

| B7 | ✅ `7ae5597` | Stealth link visible in main nav |
| B8 | ✅ `75f4a92` | MAC spoof didn't persist across reboot (no boot re-apply; response falsely claimed it did) — now a systemd-networkd `.link` file |
| B9 | ✅ `75f4a92` | DuckDNS marked itself `enabled` even when the update returned `KO` |
| B10 | ✅ `75f4a92` | AI-agent `key` steps were a no-op TODO — now fire via kvmd `send_key`/`send_shortcut` |
| B11 | ✅ `75f4a92` | net `_ro()` used `|| true` (could leave rootfs writable); wifi/scan blocked the event loop with `time.sleep`; stealth safe-mode returned a false "validated on hardware" note |
| — | 🟡 OPEN | nginx RAM-log EACCES (V1-era, low priority, verify on V2) |

## 🧭 Decisions on record (so they don't get re-litigated)
- **Virtual media + serial console = out of scope** (Raj, personal single-target use).
- **AI agent hidden** until Raj chooses to reveal it.
- **No cloud phone-home by default**; local-first.
- **Power (ATX)** kept but with an honest "needs wiring" note (can't auto-detect).
- **Wake-on-LAN removed** (useless over WiFi-only with no wired target NIC).
- **Stealth page** reached only by direct `/stealth/` URL + its password; no nav link.
- **Dependency-free frontend** (no CDN) — hand-roll small things; it's a self-hosted offline-capable tool.
- **Realistic, creative, codebase-grounded features** — not generic admin-panel checklist items.

## 🔧 Maintenance protocol (how to keep this file honest)
1. When you START a task, note it under Pending (or a new "In progress" line).
2. When you FINISH, move it to "Recently completed" **with the commit hash**, and flip its bug
   ID to ✅ if applicable.
3. When you DISCOVER a bug, add it to the Bug ledger as OPEN immediately.
4. Update **Repo HEAD** and **Last updated** at the top after each push.
5. Anything genuinely novel/non-obvious you learned → also add it to
   `docs/MAGICBRIDGE_SYSTEM.md` so the next fresh chat inherits it.
