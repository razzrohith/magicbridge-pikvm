# MagicBridge DIY → PiKVM port handoff

Everything the DIY session (bare Pi 4B + C790, Python/aiohttp stack) built or
fixed that the **PiKVM V4 Mini** project (`magicbridge-pikvm`, kvmd fork + our
services, CM4, root@172.16.20.209) should evaluate and adapt.

**Golden rule (`MAGICBRIDGE_SYSTEM.md §8`): port the IDEA and the stealth-safe
design, never blind-copy the code.** DIY = bare Python/aiohttp + SFTP deploy;
PiKVM = kvmd + our add-on services + git-tree deploy (`align_pi.py`). Re-verify
each item against kvmd; some are already handled natively there.

Tags: **[PORT]** adapt to kvmd · **[SKIP]** kvmd already has it · **[VERIFY]**
check PiKVM's own equivalent · **[PORT-concept]** take the idea, not the code.

## 🔒 Anonymity / security (do these first)
1. **Session logs RAM-only** `[VERIFY]` — DIY's backend was writing connection
   IPs + User-Agents + timestamps to the SD card; moved to a tmpfs log dir.
   Confirm every MagicBridge/kvmd/nginx access/session log on PiKVM goes to RAM
   (tmpfs), never the rootfs. **Gotcha (found the hard way):** do NOT mount that
   tmpfs `mode=1777`. A world-writable sticky dir holding nginx logs owned by
   `www-data` trips the kernel's `fs.protected_regular` (Bookworm default = 2),
   which blocks even root from opening the not-owned log files — `nginx -t` then
   fails and any *re-install* aborts (first install works because the logs don't
   exist yet). Mount it `mode=0755 root:root` (all log writers run as root; nginx
   creates its logs as root then hands them to www-data).
2. **nginx HTTP→HTTPS redirect logged visitor IPs to disk** `[VERIFY]` — the
   port-80 redirect vhost had no `access_log off`, so every first visit wrote an
   IP to the SD card. Check PiKVM's redirect vhost has `access_log off` (or RAM).
3. **Realistic monitor EDID by default** `[PORT]` — the base EDID advertised the
   monitor name **"MagicBridge"** (a dead giveaway); changed to **DELL P2419H /
   DEL** (identity only). Ensure PiKVM's EDID monitor name/manufacturer is a real
   monitor, not "MagicBridge"/a tell. (kvmd EDID differs; V4 Mini can do 1080p60
   so timings differ — but the **identity** must be realistic.)
4. **Realistic MAC on by default (was the real Pi/CM4 OUI `dc:a6:32…`)** `[PORT]`
   — the default MAC is a network tell every router client-list / scanner labels
   "Raspberry Pi". DIY now **auto-spoofs a real vendor MAC on first boot**
   (`_ensure_default_mac`, picks a verified Dell/HP/Samsung OUI + random suffix)
   and **persists it at the NetworkManager layer** via
   `/etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/00-mb-macspoof.conf` (`wifi/ethernet.cloned-mac-
   address`). Key lesson: the old `ip link set … address` approach **silently
   reverts** because NM reasserts the permanent MAC on reconnect — you must set
   `cloned-mac-address` on the connection/global default, not just the link.
   `mb-secret-reset` deletes the conf so each unit regenerates. Opt out with
   config `mac_autospoof:false`. Caveat: changing the WiFi MAC can move the DHCP
   lease/IP — reach the unit via mDNS. Port to kvmd (its own NM/dhcp setup).
5. **Realistic identity defaults, verified** `[VERIFY]` — USB = Logitech USB
   Receiver, Monitor = Dell. Verify ALL spoofing (USB, MAC, EDID) defaults to
   realistic values out of the box on PiKVM — on normal startup AND on a fresh
   SD-card first boot (no manual step). In DIY: USB falls back to Logitech in
   `mb-gadget.sh` even with no config; EDID auto-applies via `mb-hdmi-init`; MAC
   auto-spoofs on first boot; all survive `mb-secret-reset` on a clone.
5b. **Hostname + mDNS were name tells** `[PORT]` — the system hostname was
   literally **`magicbridge`** (broadcast via the DHCP hostname option + mDNS →
   shows as "magicbridge" in any router client list), and an alias service
   published **`magicbridge.local` + `raj.local`**. Both broken. DIY now sets a
   realistic per-unit **`DESKTOP-XXXXXXX`** hostname (idempotent across updates;
   regenerated per unit by `mb-secret-reset`) and makes branded aliases **opt-in**
   (`mdns_alias` in config, off by default) — avahi's automatic
   `<hostname>.local` + the IP still reach the unit. Check PiKVM's hostname
   (`pikvm`/`raspberrypi` would be tells) and any `.local` alias.
5c. **Provisioning must not RE-brand the hostname** `[PORT]` — a subtle trap
   found in the checkup: DIY's WiFi-provisioning script treated a realistic
   `DESKTOP-*` hostname as an "imaging-tool default" and reset it back to
   `magicbridge`, silently undoing the spoof mid-provision. ANY code path that
   "normalizes" the hostname must KEEP realistic names and only replace an
   actual tell. Audit every place PiKVM sets the hostname (install, provision,
   first-boot) so none of them fight each other.
5d. **Two install-script bugs the full-reinstall path hit (both fixed)** `[VERIFY]`
   — check PiKVM's equivalents: (1) the RAM-log tmpfs must be `mode=0755`, NOT
   `1777` — a world-writable sticky dir holding www-data-owned nginx logs trips
   `fs.protected_regular` (Bookworm default 2) so even root can't open them and
   `nginx -t` fails, aborting a re-install (first install works only because the
   logs don't exist yet). See item 1. (2) A `tr -dc … </dev/urandom | head -c N`
   generator SIGPIPEs `tr` (rc 141); under `set -euo pipefail` that aborts the
   whole script — guard any such pipeline with `|| true`.

## 📶 WiFi / provisioning
6. **Captive-portal dnsmasq `:53` conflict** `[VERIFY]` — DIY's setup-AP dnsmasq
   couldn't bind `:53` (a system dnsmasq held it) → dead hotspot. Fixed with
   stop-system-dnsmasq + `bind-dynamic` + `except-interface=lo` + `rfkill unblock`.
   Same class as PiKVM's earlier portal saga (bug #3) — confirm `mb-portal.sh`
   already handles it.
7. **Saved-WiFi PSK reveal truncated PSKs with a colon** `[VERIFY]` — DIY used
   `nmcli -t | split(':')[-1]`; fixed with `nmcli -e no -g`. PiKVM uses
   wpa_supplicant — check its PSK-reveal parses the conf correctly.

## 🎥 Video / WebRTC
8. **Built the Janus ustreamer plugin + wired WebRTC/H.264** `[SKIP]` — a huge
   DIY effort (janus-gateway.pc, `abs_capture_ts` patch, config dir, `video.sink`
   key). **kvmd already has native Janus/WebRTC.** This was DIY catching up to
   PiKVM. Skip entirely.
8b. **Auto-detect the capture hardware: CSI board vs USB dongle** `[PORT-concept]`
   — DIY now detects the capture device at runtime and picks the pipeline: the
   C790/TC358743 CSI board → H.264/WebRTC (DEFAULT/preferred), a USB UVC dongle
   (MS2109/MS2130/Cam Link) → MJPEG; if both are present the CSI board wins. One
   image now works on either hardware with no config. `video.device_type()`
   classifies a V4L2 node (`tc358743`/`unicam`/`fe801000` = csi, bus `usb-*` =
   usb) and `mode="auto"` resolves it. **Verified live on both** a real C790
   (1080p50 H.264, EDID cap enforced) and an MS2109 (1080p MJPEG, real frame
   captured). Two things to carry over: (a) the EDID/timings bring-up script must
   SKIP a USB dongle — never push `--set-edid` onto one (it has its own fixed
   EDID); (b) stealth caveat — the restricted-EDID trick (1080p50 cap + Dell
   monitor identity) is **CSI-only** (it lives in the TC358743), so on the USB
   path the dongle's own EDID is what the target sees. If PiKVM ever ships a
   USB-capture variant, port this detection; otherwise it's informational.

## 🖱 HID / input
9. **Absolute + relative mouse** `[PORT-UI-only]` — DIY had to build a whole
   absolute HID gadget descriptor. **kvmd already supports absolute/relative**
   (`mouse_output`). Just add the UI toggle using kvmd's capability; the
   descriptor work is N/A.
10. **Esc = hold-to-exit** `[PORT]` — single Esc tap forwards to the target;
    hold ~2.5s releases control. Frontend (Keyboard Lock API + timer).
11. **Predictive cursor overlay (relative mode)** `[PORT]` — a local dot shows
    movement instantly while the remote cursor catches up. Less needed if PiKVM
    defaults to absolute.
12. **Scroll silently dropped** `[VERIFY]` — frontend sent WS `scroll`, backend
    only handled `wheel`. Check PiKVM's wheel/scroll path.

## 🖥 UI / UX (web page)
13. **Connected-viewers + live device details** `[PORT]` — top-bar chip (who's
    connected count) + a System-tab list with IP · browser+OS · duration; backend
    exposes viewers in `/api/status`. kvmd may already expose sessions.
14. **"How the target sees it" identity card** `[PORT]` — shows the monitor
    (EDID) identity next to the USB identity, framed as "what the target sees"
    (not "spoofed").
15. **Live status polling** `[PORT]` — 5s poll while the page is visible (counts
    weren't auto-refreshing).
16. **Settings reorg** `[PORT]` — pulled **Software Update into its own
    category** (was under Power); sub-nav Monitor · Devices · Security · Power ·
    Update, with a status dot that goes amber when an update waits.
17. **Copy cleanup** `[PORT]` — removed ALL em dashes (an "AI text" tell),
    shortened verbose helper texts, fixed a duplicate "Check for updates" button.
    Apply the same voice to PiKVM's UI.

## 📟 OLED (if the V4 Mini screen applies)
18. **OLED status-override + first-boot/WiFi guidance** `[PORT-if-OLED]` — a
    `/run/…/oled-status` file the setup steps write to ("First setup, please
    wait", "Join hotspot MagicBridge-Setup").
19. **Animated "Updating" indicator** `[PORT-if-OLED]` — title + spinner + a
    Knight-Rider scanning bar during updates.

## 📦 Installer / imaging / updates
20. **Flashable image + first-boot personalization** `[PORT — high value]` —
    `mb-firstboot` (install/personalize on first boot with OLED guidance) +
    `mb-secret-reset` (regenerate per-unit secrets: SSH host keys, TLS,
    machine-id, auth→defaults, USB serial, clear baked WiFi/Tailscale) +
    `build-image.sh` + `docs/IMAGE_BUILD.md` runbook. Build a distributable
    MagicBridge-PiKVM image the same way (base = PiKVM OS). **Adapt the
    secret-reset for kvmd's secrets/certs** so units never ship shared creds.
    `build-image.sh` also **strips the per-unit identity** so no two flashed
    units collide/cross-link: the spoofed MAC (`00-mb-macspoof.conf` +
    `mac_persist={}`) AND `video.mode=auto` (so a unit flashed onto USB-capture
    hardware doesn't inherit the golden unit's CSI mode). Do the same for PiKVM.
21. **Idempotent installer + `--check` doctor** `[PORT-concept]` — installer is
    safe to re-run and has a read-only status report. Fold into `magic-install.sh`;
    add `--check`. (Mirrors PiKVM's open "installer gap" about file-level rebrands
    living outside the git tree.)
22. **Incremental vs full updates, auto-detected** `[PORT-concept]` — the updater
    diffs `HEAD..origin`: small change → copy only changed files + restart the
    affected service; structural change → full reinstall. Adapt to PiKVM's
    `align_pi.py` (git-reset): trivial diffs = fast path, structural = full.
23. **OLED "Updating…" during self-update; canonical repo URL pinned; git
    `safe.directory` for the root-run updater** `[PORT-concept / VERIFY]`.
24. **Four first-boot bugs the DIY end-to-end flash test caught** `[PORT — VERIFY hard]`
    — every one appeared ONLY on a real flash, never on the build host. Check
    PiKVM's equivalents before you ship a base image:
    - **(i) Fresh flash boots on WiFi but SSH + web are DEAD.** The image ships
      with the SSH host keys + TLS cert STRIPPED (correct — per-unit), so sshd and
      the web server start EARLY and fail before first-boot regenerates them, and
      nothing restarts them → the unit looks up (OLED shows its IP) but nothing
      answers. Fix: after `mb-secret-reset` regenerates the keys/cert, RESTART
      those early services. (kvmd: `kvmd-nginx` + sshd; regen must be
      unconditional too — see IMAGING.md status note.)
    - **(ii) That restart can DEADLOCK first-boot.** Restarting a service ordered
      *after* the first-boot unit (DIY: `magicbridge`; kvmd: `kvmd`/`kvmd-nginx`
      if ordered after your first-boot) from *inside* first-boot blocks forever —
      the restart waits for first-boot to finish, which is waiting on the restart.
      Symptom: hangs before WiFi provisioning → no hotspot, OLED never progresses.
      Fix: restart ONLY services NOT ordered after first-boot (sshd + the web
      server), or use `--no-block`.
    - **(iii) The captive portal can't bind :80 because the web server holds it.**
      The portal needs `AP_IP:80`; nginx/kvmd-nginx listens on `0.0.0.0:80`. The
      portal dies with "Address already in use", provisioning tears the AP down,
      and the user stares at "join hotspot" for a hotspot that's gone. LATENT: it
      only appears once the web server actually starts (bug i's fix un-hid it).
      Fix: stop the web server for the duration of provisioning, restore it after
      (on the failure path too). Verify `mb-portal.sh` vs kvmd-nginx.
    - **(iv) A stuck unit is undiagnosable — write a report to the FAT boot
      partition.** A unit with no WiFi and no working hotspot is unreachable, and
      its ext4/root logs can't be read on Windows/macOS (`wsl --mount` refuses
      removable SD readers). DIY now mirrors a plain-text report (who holds :80,
      is hostapd running, portal exit, log tails) to `/boot/firmware/*.txt`, which
      any OS reads. PiKVM's boot partition is `PIBOOT` (FAT) — do the same.
25. **Base = repo HEAD, not a raw golden snapshot** `[PORT-concept]` — DIY's
    `build-image.sh` deploys the FULL repo HEAD into the image and syncs the baked
    git clone to `origin/main`, so a fresh unit reports "up to date" (not a
    day-one N-commit full reinstall) and the web updater is only ever used for
    FUTURE releases. It also strips `wtmp`/`btmp`/`lastlog` (the golden unit's
    login/reboot history otherwise ships and cross-links units). Adapt to
    `align_pi.py`.

26. **Wrong WiFi password STRANDED the unit (no wifi, no hotspot)** `[PORT — VERIFY hard]`
    — found on a real fresh setup, and the nastiest UX bug of the lot. DIY's
    provisioning did `nmcli connection up "$SSID" || true`, **never checked the
    result**, announced "Connected!" on the OLED anyway, and had already torn the
    AP down — so a mistyped password left the unit with **no WiFi and no hotspot,
    recoverable only by power-cycling**. Fix: (a) VERIFY the connection actually
    reached NM state `connected` (poll ~24s), (b) on failure DELETE the bad
    profile so wrong creds are never kept, (c) **re-raise the setup hotspot**
    (DIY re-execs the provisioning script) so the user just rejoins and retries,
    (d) cap retries via an exported counter (4) then stop with a clear
    power-cycle message, (e) raise the unit's `TimeoutStartSec` so a retry can't
    be killed mid-flow. Check `mb-portal.sh`/kvmd's equivalent: **any** path that
    tears down the AP before confirming the new connection has this bug.
27. **Stale unit files in the image silently undo script fixes** `[PORT]` — the
    26 fix landed in the script, but the built image still carried the OLD
    `.service` (with the short timeout) because the image builder only deployed
    the *first-boot* unit files. Half the fix shipped. **Deploy EVERY unit file
    from the repo when arming**, and add `--verify` assertions for the specific
    values that matter (DIY now asserts the retry logic is present, the timeout
    is raised, and the mDNS alias is set) so this fails the build instead of
    shipping. Caught only by verifying the built artifact, not the commit.
28. **Headless (no-OLED) units need a name — mDNS default reversed** `[PORT-concept]`
    — with no screen there is no way to discover the unit's IP, so DIY reversed
    item 5b and now ships `mdns_alias="magicbridge"` **on by default**
    (`magicbridge.local`). Trade-off documented rather than hidden: it's a
    LAN-visible name and multiple units sharing it COLLIDE (avahi renames the
    losers), so a fleet wants a unique/innocuous name per unit or `""` for full
    stealth — the target (USB/HDMI) never sees it either way. Also worth knowing:
    when `.local` "doesn't work" it is almost always a **client-side VPN**
    (NordVPN etc.) hijacking DNS / blocking LAN mDNS, not the unit.
29. **USB capture that vanishes is a POWER problem, not software** `[VERIFY]` —
    a DIY unit powered over USB-C from a laptop port showed "NO CAPTURE DEVICE":
    `lsusb` listed no capture device and `/dev/video1` was gone, after having
    worked minutes earlier. Enumerate→work→disappear = insufficient USB power.
    Before debugging capture code, check `vcgencmd get_throttled` and put the Pi
    on a real 5V/3A supply. (The same unit also dropped off the network entirely.)

30. **New config defaults NEVER reach already-installed units** `[PORT — check hard]`
    — the sharpest one of this batch, because it makes a "shipped" fix silently
    a no-op on the existing fleet. DIY's installer wrote `config.json` only when
    it was **absent** (`"already exists, skipping"`). So a Pi upgraded through
    the web UI took every code change — repo HEAD, the item-26 WiFi retry, the
    item-27 timeout — and STILL had no `mdns_alias`, leaving `magicbridge.local`
    dead on exactly the headless units item 28 added it for. Every future default
    had the same hole. Fix: **backfill MISSING keys only**, never overwrite an
    existing value (so a deliberate `mdns_alias:""` survives, and auth hashes /
    saved settings are untouched), write via temp+`os.replace` so an interrupted
    upgrade can't truncate the config and brick the backend, and make it
    idempotent. CHECK your own installer/updater: does an upgrade reconcile
    config schema, or only code? Test it the honest way — take a unit installed
    from an OLD build, upgrade it through the real UI path, and diff its config
    against the current defaults. A green update log is not evidence.
    Related trap: DIY only caught this because the update classifier treats
    `install.sh` as structural and re-runs it; if your updater only rsyncs files,
    a config migration will never run at all.

31. **The updater reported "up to date" while running NONE of the update** `[PORT — the worst one]`
    — a shutdown landed mid-`install.sh`. The `git pull` had already succeeded,
    so the clone sat at the new commit while **nothing was deployed** — and
    because the updater compared clone-HEAD to origin, the UI said *"Up to
    date"* and there was **no way to retry from the web UI at all**. Verified on
    the live unit: repo at the new SHA, running `index.html` missing its newest
    code, config missing its newest key. Silently stale, and claiming to be
    current. Root cause is structural and almost certainly present in any
    pull-then-install updater: **the pull advances state that the install has not
    yet applied.** Fix: the installer stamps a `deployed-commit` file as its LAST
    step, success-only (and the incremental path stamps after its copies), and
    the updater compares THAT to origin — never HEAD. A missing/garbage stamp
    must report "deployment unverified → reinstall", so a unit can never be
    trapped in a fake up-to-date state. CHECK: kill your installer halfway, then
    ask the UI whether an update is available. If it says no, you have this bug.
32. **The installer pulls the repo it is RUNNING FROM** `[PORT — subtle, silent]`
    — `git` replaces a file by rename, so the already-open fd still points at the
    OLD inode and bash executes the **pre-pull text to the end**. The freshly
    pulled installer logic never runs, and the script **exits 0**. Concretely:
    the item-31 stamp landed on disk and was silently skipped; the run "succeeded"
    while doing the old thing, and the stamp only appeared on a *second* run.
    Fix: checksum `$0` around the pull and re-exec if it changed, bounded by an
    env var so it can re-exec exactly once. CHECK any script that updates its own
    source tree — a green exit code proves nothing here.
33. **A config-read-once service needs restarting after a config migration**
    `[PORT]` — the item-30 backfill added the mDNS key long after that oneshot had
    already run and exited with "no alias configured", so the unit stayed
    unreachable by name until a reboot. Migrating config is only half the job;
    restart whatever caches it, and report which way it ended up.
34. **An expired session made EVERY control silently do nothing** `[PORT — check hard]`
    — "Shutdown Pi" appeared to work and the Pi stayed up. nginx had the truth:
    `POST /api/power 401`, twice. Nothing in the UI checked `fetch()` status, so
    the 401 was invisible and the button toasted "Shutting down…" *before* the
    request even went out. Every other control shared the blind spot: an expired
    session left the page looking alive and completely dead. Dangerous here
    specifically — believing a Pi is off and pulling its power is exactly the
    SD-corruption the button exists to prevent. Fix: ONE `fetch()` wrapper
    handling 401 for every call site (toast + bounce to login, once, with the
    login endpoint excluded so a wrong password can't loop) beats auditing ~40
    call sites. Same class on the server: `Popen` fire-and-forget returned
    `ok:True` even when the command failed, so broken sudo looked identical to
    success — run it, check the return code, report the real error.
35. **Power actions and update actions knew nothing about each other** `[PORT]`
    — the UI let a shutdown land in the middle of `install.sh`. Worse, the
    aftermath *looks* like a hang: a halted Pi keeps the OLED powered but stops
    driving it, so the panel freezes on "Upgrading" forever and invites a power
    pull on top of an already-interrupted install. Fix: run the upgrade as a
    **named** unit (not an anonymous transient) so "is an upgrade in flight?" is
    answerable, have the power endpoint return 409-busy, make the UI raise a
    second explicit confirm rather than a toast, and keep a `force` override so a
    wedged upgrade can never permanently trap a unit.
36. **Update classifier forced a full reinstall for files the Pi never runs**
    `[PORT — low value, quick]` — classifying real history showed 7 of 25 commits
    triggering a full reinstall, but 3 were classifier bugs: a **Windows** `.ps1`
    helper that only ever runs on the operator's laptop, and a newly added Pi-side
    script nobody had registered. Both hit the "unknown file → full" fallback.
    Keep that fallback (an unregistered runtime file must reach the installer
    rather than silently not deploy) but exclude host-only files and register new
    ones. Worth doing the same audit: classify your last ~25 commits and look at
    which fulls were genuine.

**Amendment to item 29** (`get_throttled`): the DIY power work established the
decode that makes it actionable — bits 0–3 are *happening now*, bits 16–19 are
*has happened since boot* and are **sticky until power-cycle**. So `0x50000` means
"under-voltage occurred at some point", NOT "under-voltage now"; a Pi can show it
for hours because of a plug-in inrush transient that recovered in seconds
(confirmed in dmesg: `Undervoltage detected!` → `Voltage normalised` 8s later).
Read the two halves separately, and only trust a reading taken on a fresh boot.
(The DIY power-path A/B results are deliberately NOT ported — different board,
different power design.)

# Audit round (2026-07-22) — FILTERED for the PiKVM stack

A six-pass audit of DIY found ~20 real issues. Most were fixed there. **This
section lists ONLY the ones that plausibly apply to magicbridge-pikvm**, checked
against your actual code first (`services/`, `provision/portal.py`, `nginx/`,
`common/mbcommon.py`) so you aren't sent chasing DIY-specific bugs.

## Applies — evidence found in your tree

37. **Blocking `subprocess.run` inside async aiohttp handlers freezes ALL input**
    `[APPLIES - confirmed pattern]` — your custom services are aiohttp
    (`from aiohttp import web`, `async def` handlers in
    `magicbridge-stealth/app.py`, `magicbridge-net/app.py`) AND they call
    `subprocess.run` directly via the `sh()` helpers
    (`magicbridge-net/app.py:47`, `magicbridge-stealth/app.py:89`,
    `common/mbcommon.py:76`), plus `provision/portal.py`. aiohttp is
    single-threaded: for the whole duration of any such command, EVERY connected
    client's keyboard/mouse and all status polling is frozen. DIY measured this
    as up to a 2-minute stall on a Tailscale install. Fix shape: a
    `run_in_executor` wrapper for anything that can take more than a few hundred
    ms (network calls, package installs, `nmcli`/`iptables` batches). Cheap
    commands can stay inline.
    **-> PiKVM 2026-07-22 (`3312a71`): APPLIED - confirmed present and worse than
    described.** The worst blocker was `tailscale_install`: pacman (120s) plus a
    `curl|sh` fallback (180s) = up to ~5 minutes of a completely dead KVM. Added
    `sh_a()` (async `sh`) and `run_blocking()` (ONE executor hop for a whole batch,
    so rw/ro windows and firewall/MAC sequences stay coherent in a single thread),
    then routed the long work through them: tailscale install/up/down/funnel, the
    iptables lockdown batch, MAC set/clear (interface down/up), wifi scan/connect,
    the reverse-DNS client lookup (`gethostbyaddr` per peer - hangs for seconds),
    ping/iw latency, git fetch, the whole update deploy, `kvmd-edidconf --apply`,
    journalctl, VNC start/stop. Cheap local calls (git rev-parse, `systemctl
    is-active`, `command -v`, chmod, sysfs echo) stay inline; an AST sweep confirms
    only those remain. **Verified offline A/B against the REAL module** with `sh`
    stubbed to a 2s command: before, a fast `/health` was blocked until t=6.00s
    (loop frozen); after, it was served at t=0.21s while the slow command ran.
    (pending) the hold-a-key-during-an-install hardware proof - the device has been
    unreachable (NordVPN blocking the LAN) for this whole round.
38. **Corrupt config must not silently reset auth to defaults** `[APPLIES - the
    load half only]` — your SAVE path is already correct: `mbcommon.py` writes
    `tmp` then `os.replace` with a `# atomic` comment and chmod 0600, so DIY's
    truncating-write bug does NOT apply to you. **Check the other half**: when
    the config fails to PARSE at startup, does your code treat it as "empty" and
    bootstrap defaults? In DIY that path rewrote the DEFAULT password with 2FA
    off and wiped every other section - a single unlucky unplug silently
    reverted a stealth device to a public default password. Fail CLOSED instead:
    keep the corrupt file, log loudly, refuse to bootstrap over it. (Also worth
    adding: `fsync` the tmp file before `os.replace` - the rename is atomic but
    without fsync the contents aren't guaranteed on disk first.)
    **-> PiKVM 2026-07-22 (`8fa4c27`): APPLIED - and the load half was worse here
    than in DIY.** The save path was left alone (already correct). The load half:
    `_read_json` swallowed ANY parse error -> `None`; `load_config` saw a non-dict ->
    returned the caller's default `{}`; and `_check_pw` reads
    `if not cfg.get("hash"): return True  # no gate configured -> open`. So a corrupt
    `stealth_auth.json` did not reset the password to a default - **it removed the
    stealth gate entirely**. A truncated file is exactly what a power cut during a
    write produces, so that was a real path from an unlucky unplug to a wide-open
    USB identity panel. Added `ConfigCorruptError`: a file that EXISTS but will not
    parse (including zero-length) is no longer downgraded to "empty" - `load_config`
    logs loudly and raises, and the bad file is deliberately left on disk so nothing
    bootstraps over it. `_check_pw` and `lock_status` fail CLOSED (deny; never report
    "no password set" merely because the config was unreadable). `save_config` now
    fsyncs the tmp file and the directory around `os.replace`. **Verified offline
    A/B:** before, zero-length / truncated / garbage configs all returned
    access_granted=True (gate open) x3; after, all three denied, with a healthy
    config still accepting the right password and rejecting the wrong one.
39. **Verify USB identity writes actually took; never fire-and-forget**
    `[APPLIES - shared configfs core]` — you write the gadget identity under
    `/sys/kernel/config/usb_gadget/kvmd/...`. DIY found that swallowing configfs
    write errors made the panel report a new identity applied while the target
    still enumerated the OLD device - a silent stealth mismatch, the exact class
    this project cares most about. You already read the serial back from configfs
    as source of truth (good); extend that to the WRITE path: surface failures,
    read the strings back after the rebind, and tell the operator if the live
    gadget didn't accept it. Related and worth re-checking: any unbind/rebind of
    the UDC must reattach in a `finally`, or a failure in between leaves the
    target with no keyboard/mouse.
    **-> PiKVM 2026-07-22 (`37eaf68`): APPLIED, both halves.** (1) The write was
    fire-and-forget: the panel reported "applied" purely from `systemctl start
    kvmd-otg` returning 0, which does NOT prove the target enumerates our identity -
    a silently-rejected override left the operator believing the device looked like
    a Logitech receiver while the target still saw the old one. Added
    `_live_gadget_strings()` (reads idVendor/idProduct + manufacturer/product/
    serialnumber straight from configfs) and `verify_identity()`, comparing against
    the SANITIZED values actually written; all four apply paths now run
    `apply_identity()` = write -> rebuild -> READ BACK -> verify, returning
    `ok = started AND verified` plus `live{}` and `mismatches[]` so the operator is
    told exactly which field the gadget refused. (2) `rebuild_gadget` tears the
    gadget down and only the `rc != 0` branch retried - any other failure path
    returned with the target having NO keyboard/mouse. The sequence is now wrapped
    so a `finally` always checks UDC binding and makes a last-ditch reattach, logging
    loudly either way. **Verified offline against a simulated configfs, 5/5:** target
    still on `PiKVM`/`Composite Device`/`CAFEBABE` -> 5 mismatches caught; serial
    silently not applied -> caught; UDC empty -> caught; single wrong string ->
    caught; all-match -> verified. (pending) hardware re-verification.
40. **Image/deploy must strip EVERY per-unit secret, and `--verify` must check**
    `[APPLIES as a class - your secrets differ]` — DIY shipped a distributable
    image whose scrub was a strict subset of its first-boot secret-reset, so it
    could ship a DuckDNS token in cleartext, a baked shared MAC unit, a plaintext
    WiFi PSK, and provider API keys - and verify passed anyway because it never
    checked for them. Your secret set is different, so don't copy the list:
    enumerate what YOUR golden unit accumulates (tokens, keys, MAC/identity
    units, saved WiFi, machine-ids, logs), make the image scrub a superset of
    your first-boot reset, and add an assertion per item so a leak FAILS the
    build instead of shipping.
    **-> PiKVM 2026-07-22 (`9aa5e1c`): APPLIED as a class.** Enumerated what OUR
    golden unit accumulates rather than copying DIY's list. Two real scrub gaps -
    cleared by NEITHER the image nor the first-boot reset: **`macros.json`** (agent
    macros are user-authored keystroke sequences, and a macro very often IS a typed
    password) and **Tailscale beyond `tailscaled.state`** (backup state, derp cache,
    per-node certs all survived). Both now stripped in both places. The core of the
    item was the missing assertions: `--verify` checked only a subset, so a silently
    failed strip would ship. Added one assertion per secret - runtime net/stealth/
    stealth_auth/agent/macros JSONs absent, tailscale state (any variant) + certs
    absent, totp.secret empty, no root bash history, hostname is the placeholder, no
    saved WiFi `psk=`, plus content-level sweeps for a DuckDNS token and LLM API key
    material anywhere in our dirs. **Deliberately still KEPT** (documented,
    anonymity-neutral): `/etc/magicbridge/kvmd.json`, `stealth_auth.json` and kvmd's
    `htpasswd` hold only SHARED documented defaults - identical on every unit, so
    they cannot cross-link units, and an operator's own change lands in `/var/lib`,
    which IS stripped. **Verified** by running the assertions against a deliberately
    LEAKING fixture and a clean one: 8/9 fired on the leak, 0 on the clean image -
    and the 9th (LLM key sweep) did NOT fire because `[A-Za-z0-9]` stops at the
    hyphen in `sk-proj-...`; fixed the class and re-tested, now catching sk-proj /
    sk-ant / sk- / AIza / xai with no false positives on benign config.

## Worth a one-line check (lower confidence)

41. `[CHECK]` **Is the video stream reachable without a session?** DIY proxied
    `/stream` and `/snapshot` straight to ustreamer, bypassing auth entirely -
    anyone on the LAN/tailnet could watch the target's screen. kvmd normally
    gates its streamer, so this is probably already fine for you, but your
    `nginx/magicbridge.conf` comment notes `/streamer` is deliberately left
    reachable for the cockpit - confirm that path still demands a session.
    **-> PiKVM 2026-07-22: no bypass in our config (hardware confirm pending).**
    Unlike DIY, we never proxy to ustreamer ourselves: `nginx/magicbridge.conf`
    defines NO `/streamer` or `/snapshot` location at all - the only occurrence of
    the word is the comment itself. Those paths are served entirely by kvmd's own
    nginx config and its `auth_request` gate, which we neither override nor
    duplicate, so DIY's "proxied straight past auth" bug structurally cannot exist
    here. Still owed: the one-line hardware confirm (unauthenticated
    `curl -k https://<unit>/streamer/stream` must NOT return video) - device
    unreachable this round.
42. `[CHECK]` **Can re-running the installer drop your lockdown?** Your
    `MB_LOCKDOWN` dedicated-chain design is BETTER than DIY's (which inserted
    into INPUT directly and got flushed). But a flush of INPUT still removes the
    `-j MB_LOCKDOWN` jump even though the chain survives. `magic-install.sh`
    didn't obviously touch iptables, so this may be a non-issue - just confirm
    an installer re-run can't leave the jump missing while the chain looks fine.
    **-> PiKVM 2026-07-22: installer concern N/A (evidence); found a REAL adjacent
    bug and fixed it (`95eca92`).** N/A evidence: a repo-wide grep shows the only
    iptables use outside the lockdown handler is `mb-portal.sh`, and it touches the
    **nat** table only (`-t nat -A/-F PREROUTING` for the captive redirect) - it
    never flushes filter INPUT - while `magic-install.sh` contains no iptables at
    all. So an installer re-run cannot drop the `-j MB_LOCKDOWN` jump. **But** the
    check surfaced the same failure family: `/mb/net/status` never returned
    `lockdown` at all, so the UI toggle (which reads `s.lockdown`) always showed OFF
    even right after enabling it; and nothing persists iptables across a reboot, so
    after a reboot the chain AND jump are gone while the saved config still says
    on - the user believes they are protected and they are not. `status` now probes
    the live jump and reports `lockdown` (live truth), `lockdown_configured` and
    `lockdown_drifted`. **Verified offline** with iptables stubbed: rules gone +
    config on -> live=False/drifted=True; rules present -> live=True/drifted=False.
    Deliberately NOT done: auto re-applying lockdown at boot - re-arming a firewall
    untested could lock the operator out of the web UI if they run lockdown without
    Tailscale. Needs hardware.
43. `[CHECK]` **Login brute-force protection**, only if you have custom auth.
    DIY's per-IP delay used `asyncio.sleep`, so concurrent attempts all slept in
    PARALLEL - no real cost, and no lockout ever. If kvmd handles your auth,
    N/A.
    **-> PiKVM 2026-07-22: N/A for the main login; our own gate is already correct
    (evidence).** kvmd owns the main web auth (`POST /api/auth/login`), so DIY's
    hand-rolled throttle does not apply - and an earlier round already established
    that an nginx `limit_req` in front of it is inert in kvmd's context, so it was
    honestly removed rather than shipped non-functional. The one piece of custom
    auth we do own, the stealth-panel gate, does NOT have DIY's bug: it never calls
    `asyncio.sleep`. It stores `locked_until` per IP and returns **429 immediately**
    once the threshold is passed (`_LOCK_AFTER=5`, escalating 15s->30s->60s... capped
    at 900s), so concurrent attempts all hit the same timestamp check and are all
    rejected - there is no per-request sleep to run in parallel. Previously verified
    on hardware (5 wrong attempts -> 429, and the correct password is refused during
    the window).

## Explicitly NOT for you — do not spend time on these

- **Stuck keys / Right-Ctrl chord / release-on-focus-loss** — DIY's own
  hand-rolled key handler. You use PiKVM's mature KVM web UI for key handling.
- **Video watchdog re-detect, sticky-mjpeg fallback, encoder input clamps** —
  DIY's `video.py` manages ustreamer itself; kvmd manages yours.
- **Viewer-IP XSS in the connections list** — DIY's custom viewer widget.
- **The power-path A/B results and `--h264-boost` framerate work** — different
  board and power design (though if you ever see the encoder capped at ~25fps
  on a Pi 4, `--h264-boost` is worth knowing about).

Suggested order: anonymity (1–5c) → UI/UX (13–17) → imaging (20). Skip
8, 9-descriptor. Re-verify everything against kvmd; don't copy DIY code.

All DIY anonymity changes above were verified with a full offline checkup
(compile + shell syntax + logic unit tests + EDID validation + a residual-tell
sweep, 61 checks green) — the designs are sound to port; only device-runtime
behavior (NM keeping the cloned MAC, DHCP/IP, gadget enumeration) still needs
on-hardware confirmation on each side.
